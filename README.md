# Object-Detection-in-Images

This project implements an object detection model using OpenCV and Matplotlib. The model processes images to detect and highlight objects within them. The code reads input images, applies the detection model, and visualizes the results with bounding boxes. Ideal for quick deployment and experimentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- Matplotlib

## Usage

pip install -r requirements.txt
python detect_objects.py


This README is brief but covers the essential details.
